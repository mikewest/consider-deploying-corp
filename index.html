  <h1>
    <span>Consider deploying</span><br>
    <span>Cross-Origin Resource Policy</span>
  </h1>

  <p>
    The <code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</code> (<abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Policy">CORP</abbr>)
    header allows you to control the set of origins that are empowered to include a resource. It is
    a robust defense against attacks like <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Spectre</a>, as it
    allows browsers to block a given response before it enters an attacker's process.
  </p>
  <p>
    The header has three values: <code>same-origin</code>, <code>same-site</code>, and
    <code>cross-origin</code>. Let's look at each:
  </p>

  <h2 id="same-origin">
    <a href="#same-origin">§</a>
    Limit usage with <code>same-origin</code> or <code>same-site</code>
  </h2>
  <p>
    If a resource contains interesting information about a user, or is a response from an API that
    you don't intend for others to use, then it's quite likely that you would be well-served by
    asking the browser to ensure that it can't leak into cross-origin contexts by adding the
    following response header to the relevant resources:
  </p>
  <pre><code><span class="header">Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</span>: <span class="value">same-origin</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    Some applications can't lock themselves to a single origin, as they rely on resources shared
    within a particular site. For example, consider <code>mail.example.com</code> and
    <code>www.example.com</code>, which both rely on <code>single-sign-on.example.com</code> for
    authentication, and <code>cdn.example.com</code> for static resources. These latter two origins
    could not set <code>same-origin</code>, but they can set:
  </o>
  <pre><code><span class="header">Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</span>: <span class="value">same-site</span></code></pre>

  <h2 id="cross-origin">
    <a href="#cross-origin">§</a>
    Broadly allow usage with <code>cross-origin</code>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Do you serve resources that you want other sites to embed? Perhaps you're running a widely-used
    CDN? Perhaps you're running an in-house CDN for a small suite of related sites? Perhaps you own
    a third-party widget that you want to be used broadly? In all these cases, you'll want to make
    the expectation explicit by adding the following response header to the relevant resources:
  </p>
  <pre><code><span class="header">Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</span>: <span class="value">cross-origin</span></code></pre>

  <h2 id="corp-and-isolation">
    <a href="#corp-and-isolation">§</a>
    <abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Policy">CORP</abbr> and Isolation
  </h2>

  <p>
    Today, browsers act as though
    <code><span class="header">Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</span>: <span class="value">cross-origin</span></code>
    is set on every response that lacks an explicit <abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Policy">CORP</abbr>
    header. This is a somewhat unfortunate default, and browsers are interested in shifting the
    behavior for these resources to something more like <code class="value">same-origin</code>,
    which will protect resources unless they explicitly opt-into being shared more widely. That
    shift is going to take some time, however.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the meantime, developers can opt-into a better default for their own pages by sending a
    <a href="https://wicg.github.io/cross-origin-embedder-policy/"><code class="header">Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy</code></a>
    header, which will prevent them from loading cross-origin resources that don't explicitly
    assert 
    <code><span class="header">Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</span>: <span class="value">cross-origin</span></code>
    (or grant full access via <abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">CORS</abbr>. Over time,
    browsers will begin requiring pages to
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDlfvfTJ_9e8Jdc8ehuV4zMEu9ySMCiTGMS9y0GU92k/edit">opt-into cross-origin isolation</a>
    in order to access certain features that make side-channel attacks more effective (for example,
    high-resolution timers like <code>performance.now()</code> or <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code>).
    With this in mind, it seems likely that usage of
    <code class="header">Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy</code> will increase over time, and therefore
    that <code class="header">Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</code> will be important to consider when
    configuring your server.
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular, if you host resources that others depend upon, it would be an excellent idea to
    explicitly assert a cross-origin resource policy so that you're not a roadblock to isolation.
    Happily, doing so is pretty straightforward, and supported in all modern browsers. Even more
    happily, the assertion has no effect in pre-modern browsers, so should be safe to roll out
    for all your users.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h3 id="who">
    I'm not going to be the first one to use this header, am I?
    <a href="#who">§</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    No, of course not! Many sites use it today, like BootstrapCDN, for example! And also...
    well... um... Did I mention that BootstrapCDN uses it?
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="acao">
    I already assert <code><span class="header">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</span>: <span class="value">*</span></code>
    for public resources. Do I need to add CORP too?
    <a href="#acao">§</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    That depends on the folks that depend on you. <code>ACAO: *</code> only takes effect for requests
    that were made as CORS requests, and which explicitly dropped credentials. That is,
    <code>&lt;script ... crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;</code> will continue working, but
    <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> will fail for developers who opt-into isolation.

    You can determine how many folks are making CORS-enabled requests by taking a look at incoming
    <code>Sec-Fetch-Mode</code> headers from browsers that support
    <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-fetch-metadata/">Fetch Metadata</a>. It seems likely
    that you'll see a mix of <code>cors</code> and <code>no-cors</code> requests. The former will
    continue working for isolated sites, the latter will not.
  </p>
